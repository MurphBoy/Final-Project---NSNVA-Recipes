                <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>2/3 cups cocoa powder, sifted if limpy</li>
                <li>1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted if limpy</li>
                <li>1/2 cups dark cocolate chips</li>
                <li>1/2 cups marshmellos</li>
                <li>1/2 cups dark chocolate oreos</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Instructions:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li><br></br>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, marshmellos, oreos, and salt.</li><br></br>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li><br></br>
                <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li><br></br>
                <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li><br></br>
            </ol>
            <b>Notes:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>*If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.</li>
                <li>**I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.</li>
                <li>***When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.</li>
